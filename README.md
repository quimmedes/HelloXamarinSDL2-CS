# # Hello World SDL2 from Android Xamarin or ANDROID MAUI WITH C# Visual Studio 2022 .NET 8.0 /  Android API 34
It works, I got everything built so you don't have to, it was a lot of work to make the android library being recognize by C# without breaking everything,
SDL2 version of this build is currenly 2.85.5. 
I will update to the newest Soon and also add a project for SDL3, 
take a look at my engine too, 
it will probably support Android too,
since I got the SDL2 working on Android with Xamarin/.NET,
I will probably use it on my engine too.
