# It works, Just write C# code and use SDL methods using SDL2-CS bindings already included.

- SDL2 version of this build is currenly 2.30.7
- I will add a SDL3 version soon.
- take a look at my engine too, 
-it will probably support Android too,
-since I got the SDL2 working on Android with Xamarin/.NET,
-I will probably use it on my engine too.
