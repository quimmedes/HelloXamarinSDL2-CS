# # Hello World SDL2 from Android Xamarin or ANDROID MAUI WITH C# Visual Studio 2022 .NET 8.0 /  Android API 34
I works, I got everything build so you don't need to, 
take a look at my engine too, 
it will probably support Android too,
since I got the SDL2 working on Android,
I will probably use it on my engine too.
